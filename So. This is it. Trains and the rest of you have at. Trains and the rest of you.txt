So. This is it. Trains and the rest of you have at last resorted to censorship - and you think you can get away with it?
That you can trample on my human rights - that you can disobey the Geneva Convention and go unpunished?
That is wrong, you fascistic authoritarians. I hereby withdraw from DMM development, and this includes all my assets, including, but not limited to:

- ~50% of the map/province modifications
- most history file adjustments
- all but 1 Event implemented so far 
- all scripted commands
- all scripted localisation (almost 1500 lines of code)
- all but a few idea and focus icons 
- compatibility with every patch from 1.5 onwards
- my implementation of the Republic of China and its paths
- the concept map for the Reichskommissariats
- the concept of shared and variable trees
- the loading screens I did
- the concept of modding itself 
- the music added by me 
- the added bookmarks

In summary, Trains, Miu, Aru, FPÃ–, Panzer, and especially Agatha and everyone else who agitated behind the scenes to get me demoted.
I despise people like you. You are against everything society has ever achieved. You are the abyss that, by its very existence, destroys any effort put into honorary work!

You are SCUM, you people are CANCER.

With kind regards,
