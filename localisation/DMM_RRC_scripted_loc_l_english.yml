  rrc_response_attack_heavy_1:0 "Wang begins to speak: 'Mr. Liu speaks of a 'Great Devolution', but is it not merely filthy Anarchism (...)', but he is quickly interrupted by Liu and his delegates shouting insults at him, including a particularly vicious one aimed at Wang's entire family tree, causing him to lose his composure and abandon coherent argumentation. It is dubious if anyone really looked good in this..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_2:0 "'The only thing Mr. Liu has done in this Republic is sabotage it at every turn!', is what Wang attempts to say before being quite quickly interrupted by a torrent of filibustering coming from Liu. Although it prevents Wang from being able to make his point, some elder members of the Assembly click their tongues at Liu's impertinent behaviour..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_3:0 "'This 'United Front' you lead is naught but malcontent losers(...)', Wang starts, but he is stopped by a flurry of thrown pens and even a suitcase hitting his podium, with Wang being forced to seek shelter behind his desk. Although he has been prevented from making his point, such measures are frowned upon even in the rough climate of the ROC's assembly chamber..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_4:0 "'The Youth Party was shunned by our Japanese Allies(...)', Wang attempts to continue, but is booed heavily from both the back rows of his own party and the entire PNR-YP front. Referring to the hated Japanese as 'Allies', although theoretically correct, was perhaps not the smartest move, although the Japanese-aligned delegates direct a scornful gaze towards Liu..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_5:0 "Wang shouts: 'Mr. Liu wants to dismantle the Republic itself. We MUST stop him!', but is quickly shut down when Liu launches into a furious rant about the systemic issues of the Reorganized Government, and meekly shrinks behind his desk. The Old Guard of the NDPROC watches Liu's rant with disdain..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_6:0 "'Wang tries to ride into office on his father's coattails - Are we a monarchy again?', Liu tries to argue, but is quickly drowned out by furious noises from the NDPROC ranks, as he is seen as disrepecting the dead Old President..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_7:0 "'The only change Wang can promise is one for the worse(...)', Liu attempts, but he is shouted down by Wang, who alleges that at the very least, he is realistic in his promises..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_8:0 "'Wang calls for 'Reform, not Revolution', but his actions are those of a Japanese lapdog!'. Liu's words are quickly interrupted by Wang launching into a tirade on the topic of Liu 'shaking up riots' and being responsible for the low Japanese opinion of the RNGROC..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_9:0 "'I will solve China's problems, not some dusty National Democrat in this chamber.'. This remark is quickly met with immense rage from the NDPROC's ranks, who throw a number of things, including, but not limited to: 13 pens, 2 folders full of documents, and 1 steel cigarette case. This causes Liu to take shelter behind his desk, rather ruining the point he was making..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_10:0 "Liu shouts: 'Every district which Wang's party governs is a district exploited by corrupt bureaucrats', but he is immediately interrupted by Wang, who alleges that their districts 'at least remain governable, contrary to yours'..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_11:0 "Wang begins to speak: 'Mr. Liu speaks of a 'Great Devolution', but is it not merely filthy Anarchism in disguise?'. Liu attempts to interject, but Wang just starts to speak louder: 'Mr. Liu, I ask you this? Are you not attempting to tear down everything every politician since 1911 has tried to built? A strong China, a united China. Mr. Liu, you stand against all of that, and you expect me and us all to just sit by idly while you destroy our life's work?'. Wang is applauded loudly by his delegation and Liu is left unable to answer sufficiently..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_12:0 "'The only thing Mr. Liu has done in this Republic is sabotage it at every turn!', Wang begins. Liu's attempts to make a counterpoint are swiftly swatted down, and he is subjected to almost half an hour of Wang viciously tearing apart his arguments one after the other. By the time Wang is finished, many believe this might be the killing blow to Liu's young political career..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_13:0 "'This 'United Front' you lead is naught but malcontent losers, aiming to destroy the system my father and his father worked their whole lives to build!'. Wang's invocation of the authority of his father and grandfather works, and Liu's attempts to interrupt Wang are mercilessly torn down by the NDPROC delegates. Wang goes on and on about Liu attempting 'to destroy everything we hold dear today'. By the end, Liu is catching suspicious looks from even his own party members."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_14:0 "'The Youth Party was shunned by our Japanese Allies for a reason - they are too radical!', Wang begins. 'They saw them as the threat to China that they were, and it is only because we allowed them into our midst again that Japan does not trust us!'. This catches the agreement of most of Wang's supporters, and Liu is shocked to see some of his PNR delegates cross the floor and sit with the NDP faction..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_15:0 "Wang warns: 'Mr. Liu wants to dismantle the Republic itself. We MUST stop him before it is too late!'. Liu tries to say something, but Wang talks over him: 'Liu wishes to see the Chinese state destroyed, our identity broken - He is much like the British in that regard'. Liu's attempted rebuttal is drowned out by calls to remove him from the assembly floor, and although no such thing happens, his position is weakened immensely..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_16:0 "'Wang tries to ride into office on his father's coattails - Are we a monarchy again?', Liu asks, shouting over Wang's remarks, 'Should we just invite the Manchurian Emperor back and be done with it? No, I say. Save the republic, and do not support Mr. Wang.'. This allegation seems to have convinced some of Wang's devotees, who now look at him with critical eyes..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_17:0 "Wang attempts to speak, but is cut off by Liu: 'The only change Mr. Wang can promise is one for the worse - Stagnation!', he postulates, 'He promises reform, but he has never said what kind of reform. He is vague so that he can later just agree to his Japanese Master's demands'. The storm of allegations overwhelms Wang, who fails to properly refute them all. Some of the NDP delegates even cross the floor and sit with the PNR-YP front..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_18:0 "'Wang calls for 'Reform, not Revolution', but his actions are those of a Japanese lapdog!', Liu shouts, over Wang's protests, 'Whatever he does, he always takes care to not offend his Japanese Masters. In the morning he calls Tokyo just to ask if he is allowed to brush his teeth that day'. The assembly roars with laughter at Wang's expense, who is visibly embarrassed..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_19:0 "'I will solve China's problems, not some dusty National Democrat in this chamber', Liu proclaims. 'Be quiet, your family's policies got us into this situation in the first place!', he says to Wang, quieting him down. 'While many will proclaim that the system is not flawed, these people have not been in the Interior for a day in their lives!', he continues. 'We must make changes, or we will not stand the test of time'. The PNR-YP delegation applauds, while the NDP faction is mostly silent, looking at Wang inquisitively..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_20:0 "'Mr. Liu, I believe [...]', Wang is cut off by Liu's interjection: 'Every district which Wang's party governs is a district exploited by corrupt bureaucrats'. You people call us radicals, but at the very least, we do not steal from our constituents like you. I have brought with me this document...' What follows is a brutal recounting of the systemic corruption of the National Democrats that leaves many of their more idealistic members crossing the floor to Liu's side in disgust..."
  
  rrc_response_attack_soft_1:0 "Wang starts to speak: 'My father always despised Mr. Liu. Why(...)', before he gets cut off by Liu insulting him for not making 'an argument of his own'..."
  rrc_response_attack_soft_2:0 "'Mr. Liu is ignorant of the processes of this Republic(...)'. Wang begins, but is quickly cut off by Liu shouting insults over his speech..."

  rrc_response_attack_soft_4:0 "'Why even listen to illogical accusations?(...)', Wang interjects. '(...)Then why won't you be quiet?', Liu responds. The assembly responds with laughter, and Wang is embarrassed..."

  rrc_response_attack_soft_6:0 "'Mr. Wang has difficulties calming the Assembly - how can he calm China?', Liu begins, before being interrupted by Wang, calling him various names..."
  rrc_response_attack_soft_7:0 "'The son of a president - but what other qualities does Mr. Wang have? None!', Liu starts, before NDP delegates interrupt him, insulting him for questioning their leader..."
  rrc_response_attack_soft_8:0 "'I came from Sichuan(...)', Liu begins, but he is immediately interrupted by Wang shouting 'you should have stayed there!'. The assembly laughs, and Liu is embarassed..."
  rrc_response_attack_soft_9:0 "Liu starts to speak: 'Everyone can see China is facing a great crisis(...)' but he is immediately interrupted by Wang shouting about Liu being unable to resolve these crises..."
